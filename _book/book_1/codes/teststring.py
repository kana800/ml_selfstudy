string = """Lists are another data structure, similar to NumPy arrays, but
unlike NumPy arrays, lists are a part of core Python. Lists have a variety of
uses. They are useful, for example, in various bookkeeping tasks that arise in
computer programming. Like arrays, they are sometimes used to store data.
However, lists do not have the specialized properties and tools that make
arrays so powerful for scientific computing. So in general, we prefer arrays to
lists for working with scientific data. For other tasks, lists work just fine
and can even be preferable to arrays.Strings are lists of keyboard characters
as well as other characters not on your keyboard. They are not particularly
interesting in scientific computing, but they are nevertheless necessary and
useful. Texts on programming with Python typically devote a good deal of time
and space to learning about strings and how to manipulate them. Our uses of
them are rather modest, however, so we take a minimalist’s approach and only
introduce a few of their features.Dictionaries are like lists, but the elements
of dictionaries are accessed in a different way than for lists. The elements of
lists and arrays are numbered consecutively, and to access an element of a list
or an array, you simply refer to the number corresponding to its position in
the sequence. The elements of dictionaries are accessed by “keys”, which can be
either strings or (arbitrary) integers (in no particular order). Dictionaries
are an important part of core Python. However, we do not make much use of them
in this introduction to scientific Python, so our discussion of them is
limited.LLLists are another data structure, similar to NumPy arrays, but unlike
