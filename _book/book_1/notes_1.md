- What is an algorithm? 

  algorithms are the ideas behind computer programs

- What is the correctness of an algorithm?

  for every input we get the specified output, in order to prove an algorithm is correct we need to prove the correctness of the algorithm.

- Expressing Algorithms? 

  >  Algorithms problems, must be carefully specified to allow a provably correct algorithm to exist. We can find the **shortest tour** but not the **best tour**

  we can use `pseudocode` to express the algorithm.

- Demonstrating Incorrectness

  - Counter Examples is good way to break an algorithm and disprove  the correctness of heuristic, heuristic means an algorithm that isn't correct. How do you find counter examples? , maybe we can try all the possible examples, think about examples with ties on your decision criteria, think about examples with extreme of big and small inputs.

- Induction and Recursion can be used to prove an algorithm is correct.
